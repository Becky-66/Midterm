<hr>
<p>
	 Singapore (Singapura, 新加坡, சிங்கப்பூர்) is a city-state in Southeast Asia. Founded as a British trading colony in 1819, since independence it has become one of the world's most prosperous, tax-friendly countries and boasts the world's busiest port.

	Combining the skyscrapers and subways of a modern, affluent city with a medley of Chinese, Malay and Indian influences along with a tropical climate, tasty food from hawker centres, copious shopping malls, and vibrant night-life scene, this Garden City makes a great stopover or springboard into the region.

	Singapore is one of the most popular travel destinations in the world for a lot of reasons, one of which is the less stringent entry requirements.

	Singapore is a small island country. With a population size of over 5.5 million people it is a very crowded city, third only to Monaco and Hong Kong as the world's most densely populated country.

	However, unlike many other densely populated countries, Singapore - with more than 50% of its area covered by greenery and with over 50 major parks and 4 nature reserves - is an enchanting garden city.

	Large self-contained residential towns have mushroomed all over the island, around the clean and modern city centre.

	Malay may be enshrined in the Constitution as the national language, but in practice the most common language is English, spoken by almost every Singaporean under the age of 50 with varying degrees of fluency. English is spoken much better here than in most Asian neighbours. English is also the medium of instruction in schools, except for mother tongue subjects (e.g. Malay, Mandarin and Tamil), which are also required to be learned in school by Singaporeans. In addition, all official signs and documents are written in English, usually using British spelling.
	
	Singapore's other official languages are Mandarin Chinese and Tamil. Mandarin is spoken by many older and middle aged Singaporean Chinese while many young Singaporean Chinese speak mostly English and sometimes Mandarin Chinese though fluency and proficiency of Mandarin Chinese varies among younger Singaporean Chinese due to the increasing dominance of the widespread use of English in government, education and workplaces in Singapore and the lack of emphasis of Mandarin education in Singapore schools over the past decade. Tamil is one of the Indian Languages is spoken by most Indians. Like English, the Mandarin spoken in Singapore has also evolved into a distinctive creole and often incorporates words from other Chinese dialects, Malay and English, though all Singaporean Chinese are taught standard Mandarin in school. Various Non-Mandarin Chinese languages spoken by the majority of the older generations of Chinese Singaporeans and some middle aged generations of Chinese Singaporeans, mostly Minnan (Singaporean Hokkien which is primarily based on Xiamen Minnan but mixed with English and Malay loanwords), though significant numbers also speak Cantonese are also spoken between ethnic Chinese of the same language group, though their use has been declining in the younger generation since the 1980s due to government policies discouraging the use of other Chinese languages in favour of Mandarin. Other Indian languages, such as Punjabi among the Sikhs, are also spoken.
